    * Do not think complex ideas are a bad idea as higher complexity can lead to better results

## Day 16 (22/09/25)

* Spent the day exploring and researching possible Capstone ideas

    * Simplified Batch Job Creation Platform
    * Jasper to Apache POI Modernization

## Day 17 (23/09/25)
* Francis said that jobs that are forgotten or done everyday should be automated
* Francis came up with a few pain points that was brought up:
    * Forgotten batch jobs - they normally run on their own so once created they are left alone and tend to be forgotten as there are so many batch jobs
    * Password updates causes batch job failures as sometimes passwords are inevitably hard coded into batch jobs. When password updates, the batch jobs then fail as access is no longer granted
* Leaning towards forgotten batch job ideas
* Expanding on that idea and drafting proposal for approval by Francis and Jacob

## Day 18 (24/09/25)
* Finished up the proposal, decided on Batch Job Lifecycle Monitor
* Sent to Francis for approval
* Approved by Francis, sent to Jacob for approval
