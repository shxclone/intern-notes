## Day 26 (06/10/25)
* Not much to do, worked on Capstone instead

## Day 27 (07/10/25)
* Previous CR was accidentally reverted in Git, had to put it back

## Day 28 (08/10/25)
* Was informed that the format of the work I did in previous CR that merged 4 new batch jobs into 1 existing batch job needed to be changed again:
    * They now want to split it into another batch job where 1 batch job handles the 4 batch jobs, with the existing batch job being separate
* At 4pm, Jia Jun had a meeting with the users for requirement gathering and I was told that the format for the CR changed yet again:
    * This time they want 2 batch jobs, 1 for the existing batch job and another to run exactly what the existing batch job does but with a different sql filter and also the 4 additional batch jobs
* Also had to adjust a JasperReport jrxml to change the column name of the report generated by the batch job as per user's feedback/new requirement

## Day 29 (09/10/25)
* Continued working on the changes required for the previous CR

## Day 30 (10/10/25)
