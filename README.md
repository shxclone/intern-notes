 ## Day 3
 * Training on support - handling customers by Jia Jun (Team Lead) & Yee Tang (PM)
   * Level 1 - Basic support: Ticket logging, password reset, help desk stuff
   * Level 2 - Intermediate support: Troubleshoot data, Configuration issues, Apply fixes that do not require code changes
   * Level 3 - Advanced support: Code-level issue resolutions and enhancements
   * Escalate up the levels if unable to resolve (Escalation is NOT a failure)
   * Learned about response times and how they're linked to the severity of the situation: the higher the severity, the lower the response time
   * Usually during code fixes, as developers we should test it in System Integration Testing (SIT). After testing and the issue is fixed, code changes are pushed to User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the client to make sure the program is in accordance to their requirements. Once approved, the changes will be pushed to production.
* Training on Git Lab done by Bernie & Chloe
   * Went through basic commands such as:
       * git checkout - change branch
       * git merge - merge branches
   * Go through proper sequencing - Pull from main before you make any changes on your own branch as main branch should always be the latest working version
* Introduced to SHIP-HATS - CI/CD used by Singapore Government Tech Stack

## Day 4

  * Practiced on a Java mini lab - Worked on a Servlet app, with DB connections to MySQL, hosted by Tomcat9 9 to display an image of the school, with our names pulled from the database displayed below it
  * Learned how to use Servlet as I have never used it before
* Francis sharing:
  * Before you declare your work done, test beyond your computer
  * As a Software Engineer, everything can be done. It is just whether the amount of money is right, how long it takes, and it is worth it do attempt
  * Change Tomcat port - under Tomcat 9.0 > conf > server.xml
  * .war file is where the program becomes portable
  * Production should only have JRE (Java Run Time Environment)  and should not have JDK (Java Development Kit) - should not be able to write code in production
* Went through a mandatory IT Security Awareness training session to ensure everyone understands the importance of protecting the companyâ€™s data and maintaining strong cybersecurity practices
  * Watched a Security Awareness Training video
  * Completed a questionnaire to test our understanding - 90% to pass
